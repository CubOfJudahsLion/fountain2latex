\texttt{fountain2latex} is a simple utility to convert from the
\texttt{\link{https://fountain.io/}{.fountain}} screenplay format to
the \link{https://www.latex-project.org/}{\LaTeX} screenplay subformat.
{\LaTeX} provides world-class typesetting quality for that extra bit of
class and professionalism in your script.

To be more precise, this utility specifically relies on the
\emph{\link{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/screenplay}{screenplay {\LaTeX} class}}
by \link{http://dvc.org.uk/johnny.html}{John Pate}, which implements
Academy-recommended rules. It can be found in the
\link{https://tug.org/texlive/}{TeXLive} and
\link{https://miktex.org/}{MiKTeX} distributions, both of which offer
packages for Linux, Windows and Mac.

\texttt{fountain2latex} is written in \link{https://haskell.org}{Haskell}
and compiled with GHC version 9.2.8.


\section*{Why?}

I find {\LaTeX} to be more obtrusive to my writing flow. Fountain barely
requires an extra character here or there. Having to think about the
\verb|\command{}| I need to properly format something is disrupting.
Then again, I want the sweet, sweet typesetting{\ldots}

There's gotta be a way to have my cake and eat it too.

``\emph{But Cub, you beautiful, daunting force of nature}'', I hear you say,
``\emph{there are already ways to convert fountain to other formats}''.

I know, but I'm old school (no duh. I'm actually using \emph{make} here.)
Something this simple should be just a few keystrokes in your terminal and
that's it. Zero leak risk.

Now where did I leave that gosh-darned Bengay.


\section*{Installing from release}

Download the latest release and extract all the files to any directory.
Run by typing\\
\\
\verb|    |\colorbox{Black}{\textcolor{White}{\texttt{fountain2latex \emph{<input>}[.fountain] [\emph{<output>}[.tex]]}}}\\
\\
Extensions can be omitted, and the result will be sent to standard
output if the second filename is not provided.


\section*{Installing from sources}

Needless to say, you need GHC 9.2.8+ to do this. If you don't have it,
you can always install from release, as shown in the previous section.

Just \texttt{cd} to the \texttt{fountain2latex} directory and run:\\
\\
\verb|    |\colorbox{Black}{\textcolor{White}{\texttt{make install}}}\\
\\
Which should take care of everything, including overwriting older
versions.
